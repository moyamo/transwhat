# Usage

## Bot

You might want to talk to bot if you're feeling lonely ;-P

The bot is one of the contacts every user has in its contact list. It offers you a simple way to interact with the server:

| **Command**  | **Description** |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| `\help`      | show this message |
| `\prune`     | clear your buddylist |
| `\sync`      | sync your imported contacts with WhatsApp |
| `\lastseen`  | request last online timestamp from buddy |
| `\leave`     | permanently leave group chat |
| `\groups`    | print all attended groups |
| `\getgroups` | get current groups from WA |

<note tip>All commands start with a **back**slash!</note>

## Login

To login to the transWhat, you should use the service discovery option in your XMPP client.

When asked about the login credentials, enter your data as described below:

| **Setting** | **Value**                 | **Example**     |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | --------------- |
| User        | CountryCode + PhoneNumber | 4917634911387   |
| Password    | WhatsApp password         | *Base64 string* |

### Buddies

WhatsApp does not store your contacts on their servers. Thus you need to import your contacts manually with your XMPP Client or use [[.:bot|our bot]] to Import your contacts from Google (preferred).

(In Pidgin: Menu => Buddys => Add Buddy)

Just use the same JID format as for your login:

  CountryCode + PhoneNumber + "@whatsapp.example.org"

### Groups

To chat with groups you need to add them manually to your XMPP client.

To get a list of your WhatsApp groups, you can use the Auto Discovery functionality of your XMPP client.

(In Pidgin: Menu => Buddys => Join Chat => RoomList)

### Smileys / Emojis

To be able to see smileys, you will need an [[https://github.com/stv0g/unicode-emoji/raw/master/symbola/Symbola.ttf|Unicode emoji font]].
